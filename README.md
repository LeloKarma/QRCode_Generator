 <b>~Description<br></b>
This is a QR Code Generator with JavaScript
Simple to understand and implement.

<b>~introduction</b><br>
A QR (Quick Response) code generator is a tool or software that creates QR codes, 
which are two-dimensional barcodes that can store and convey various types of information. 
These codes can be scanned by a QR code reader or scanner using a smartphone or other devices equipped with a camera.

<b>~Overview</b><br>
Here's a brief overview of how a QR code generator works:

Data Encoding: When you provide input data, such as a URL, text, contact information, or any other data type, the QR code
generator processes this data and encodes it into a QR code format.

Error Correction: To ensure the QR code remains scannable even if it gets damaged or partially obscured, 
error correction techniques are applied. Error correction allows for the recovery of the original data even if the QR code is partially unreadable.

QR Code Generation: The generator takes the encoded data and constructs a square matrix of black and white modules (dots). 
Each module represents a binary digit (0 or 1) or a specific data pattern.

Positioning Patterns: The generator adds positioning patterns to the QR code to assist with scanning and decoding.
These patterns help the scanner identify the orientation and size of the QR code.
